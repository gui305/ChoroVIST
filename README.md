## üîß Installation

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Create and Activate a Conda Environment

First, you'll need to create a dedicated conda environment for ChoroVIST. This isolates the dependencies for ChoroVIST and ensures they won't conflict with other projects.

#### 1.1 Create the Conda Environment

Run the following command to create a new environment named `chorovist` with Python 3.10:

```bash
conda create -n chorovist python=3.10
```
#### 1.2 Activate the Environment

Once the environment is created, activate it by running:

```bash
conda activate chorovist
```
### ‚ö° Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

After activating the environment, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies to run ChoroVIST.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib tqdm pandas scikit-image scipy openpyxl oct_converter tkcalendar
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Set Up the Application

Once the environment is ready and dependencies are installed, ChoroVIST should be ready to run.

#### 3.1 Clone the Repository (If You Haven't Already)

If you haven't cloned the repository yet, you can do so by running the following command in your desired directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gui305/ChoroVIST.git
```

#### 3.2 Run ChoroVIST
Now that you are in the repository directory, you can run the application using Python:

```bash
python ChoroVIST.py
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Optional Step 4: Compile the Application into an Executable App

#### 4.1 Install PyInstaller
First, install PyInstaller using pip:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

#### 4.2 Compile the Application
Run the following PyInstaller command to compile the application into an executable. This will bundle all dependencies, include necessary assets, and create a single executable file. This could take a few minutes.

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --hidden-import=skimage.measure --icon=coroide.ico --add-data "FMUL.png;." --add-data "Tecnico.png;." --add-data "OLHO.png;." --add-data "coroide.ico;." ChoroVIST.py
```

#### 4.3 Run the Executable
After compiling, you'll find the ChoroVIST executable inside the dist folder. Simply double-click to run the application like a normal app. You can change the app location understanding that the app will run over the ChoroVIST Database and Datafiles that you have in the directory of the exec.
